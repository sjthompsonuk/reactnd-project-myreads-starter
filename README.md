# MyReads Project

'MyReads' is a Udacity FEND NanoDegree Project as completed by Sam Thompson

## Project concept

The Project uses React as a framework to build/modify a single page app that can monitor which books which the user is 'Currently Reading', 'Wants to Read', or has 'Read'.

In practice this app is limited by the JSON/API provided so only certain terms can be used. Please see SEARCH_TERMS.md for these.

Additionally the app has not been compiled yet and remains in it's development state for purposes of the course

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repo....
2. Using terminal 'npm install' - to download dependancies.
3. Using terminal 'npm start' - to run the built in server to start the simulation
